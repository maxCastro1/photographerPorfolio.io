            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="intro">Welcome to my project!<br> My name is <a href="https://mizeromaxime.com/">Mizero Maxime</a></p> 
            <p class="intro-sub">
                And I'm a web developer with over 5 years
                of experience in frontend development and some knowledge in backend development. I specialize in
                designing and developing websites that are not only visually stunning but also user-friendly and
                responsive.
             </p> 
             <p>  
                My goal is to help my clients achieve their digital goals by creating websites that accurately represent
                their brand and cater to their target audience. Whether you're a small business owner, a startup, or a
                large corporation, I can provide you with the web development services you need to succeed in the online
                world.
                What sets me apart from other web developers is my unique style. I don't just follow the latest trends
                or copy what's already been done. Instead, I take the time to understand my clients' vision and create
                custom designs that are tailored to their needs. I believe that a website should not only look great but
                also be functional, intuitive, and easy to use.
             </p>
             <p>
